Want to eventually add continuation to SRTD

Suppose we want to solve a nonlinear problem F(x;l)=0 for x 
    given a parameter l


Continuation methods are used when the problem difficulty 
    generally increases with the parameter value, and the
    idea is to first solve the problem with a small parameter
    value, and use the solution from the small parameter problem
    as the initial guess for solving the problem with a larger
    parameter

The solution from the previous solve, used as the initial guess for
    the next solve, is often called the "predictor"
    

Continuation Schemes:
    "Natural parameter continuation" starts with a fixed parameter, 
        lik 0, and increments it by a constant delta_l every time. 
        That is,
            Then solve for l0
            Then solve for l1 = l0 + dl with x=x(l0) as the initial guess
            Then solve for l2 = l1 + dl with x=x(l1) as the initial guess
            and so on until we reach the desired l

    "Linear Secant Predictor"
        Usually, the natural parameter continuation is not the best choice 
        of predictors. The linear secant predictor is an easy and cheap 
        improvement

        Once we have 2 solutions, say x(l0) and x(l1), then our predictor 
        for solving x(l2) is not x(l1), but rather, 
            x_0(l2) = 2*x(l1) - x(l0)
    
    "Pseudo Arclength Continuation" is another recommended by Kelley in "Solving
        Nonlinear Equations with Iterative Methods"
